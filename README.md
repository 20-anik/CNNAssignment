# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Model Overfits if augmentation is not done.
- Once augmentation is done, model underfits slightly.
- Model performs well once we handle class imbalance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
